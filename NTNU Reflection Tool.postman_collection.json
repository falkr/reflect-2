    "description": "To get started you will need to have both the backend and the frontend running:\n\nThe frontend needs only to be active at the start so that we can get the session cookie for the backend from FEIDE\n\nSteps to get started.\n\n- Start up backend and frontend\n- Go into frontend page [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/)\n- Log in\n- When login is done, change the url from\n    - localhost/auth?code=...\n    - to\n    - 127.0.0.1:8000/auth?code=...\n- If you get an error, remember to empty the cookie berfore.\n- When that is done you will need to get the session cookie:\n- Right click -> Inspect -> Application -> Cookies\n- Copy the session token and go into the [USER](https://go.postman.co/workspace/4935485f-e6d5-45db-8b14-21d225e99973/documentation/24520570-86877364-edc6-495a-88a2-ea01f13ec83b?entity=request-62ede2f4-cd91-4068-90bc-e158b7974005) endpoint\n- Click \"Headers\" -> Update the cookie with new token -> Click send\n- If you have two fields with name Cookie, do this\n    - Click on \"Cookies\" that under the send button.\n    - Delete (click X) the \"127.0.0.1\"\n    - Now go back and update the cookie\n- This will now create a cookie that will affect all the endpoints\n- Happy coding!\n    \n\nFEIDE documentation:\n\n- Gå til main.py filen\n- finn funksjonen:\n    - def get_user_data(bearer_token):\n- Legg til:\n    - print(f\"Bearer {bearer_token}\")\n- Etter det logger du inn på vanlig måte\n- Hvis du da sjekker konsollen finner du \"token\"\n- Kopier den og gå til feide endepunktet [HERE](https://go.postman.co/workspace/4935485f-e6d5-45db-8b14-21d225e99973/documentation/24520570-86877364-edc6-495a-88a2-ea01f13ec83b?entity=request-24d76c6e-a67d-4a7a-927f-6c75fbbfc782)\n- Oppdater da Athorization Bearer token.",
