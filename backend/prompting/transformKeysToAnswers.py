    Transforms sorted answer keys into the belonging answers from the students.

    This function returns the sorted_answers dictionary, but replaces the keys with the
    actual answers from the students from answers_data.

    Parameters:
    - sorted_answers (dict): A dictionary where each key is a question and the value is another dictionary.
      This inner dictionary maps categories to a list of keys that indicate which answers belong to that category.
    - questions (list): A list of questions in the order they were asked.
    - answers_data (list): A list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the 'key' of the answer
      and 'answers' which is a list of answers corresponding to each question.

    Returns:
    - dict: A nested dictionary where the first level of keys are questions, the second level of keys are categories,
      and the values are lists of answers that fall into each category for the corresponding question.
