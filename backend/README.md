# Backend

## Requirements:

- Docker 
Or
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.9) & [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)

The backend is split into three main parts.
It consists of FastAPI, SqlAlchemy and Postgres. [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a framework for creating APIs in Python. [SqlAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org) is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that makes it easy to work with databases in Python. [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) is the database used in production. In development, sqlite is used.

# Setup & running

## Development

### Environment:

`.env` is not commited to this repo because of security, so this file has to be created.

**Both frontend and backend folders includes a `.env.template` file. This file contains the variables that has to be set in the new `.env` file.**

In the **`backend`** folder, create`.env`file containing the following:

- `production = false` (This is used to determine if the database should be sqlite or postgres)
- `SECRET_KEY = random_string` (This is used for hashing)

Feide instance (this can be created [here](https://dashboard.dataporten.no)):
- `client_id` is set
- `client_secret` is set
- `REDIRECT_URI` is set
- `BASE_URL` is set

OpenAI authentication (this can be created [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)):
- `OPENAI_KEY` is set

Note: There are some optional variables in the `.env.template` file. These are not necessary for the application to run, but can be used for testing and development.

### Running Backend :

Note: For linting the backend, the VScode extention `Black Formatter` is used. This is also visible in the [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](../.gitlab-ci.yml)-file where we have a job for checking the linting of the backend.

#### Alternative 1 (docker):
This is the recommended way to run the backend. This will start the backend in a Docker container. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
make dev
```

If you are using Windows, you can run the following commands (every command in the [Makefile](../Makefile)) manually in the terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up --no-deps backend
```

#### Alternative 2 (manual setup):

```bash
cd backend

# Creates virtual environment
python -m venv venv # only do once

# Activates virtual environment
source ./venv/bin/activate #Troubleshooting for windows below

# Installing python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Apply migration scripts
alembic upgrade head

# Run the backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Running at 127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Migrations (optinal but not necessary):

**Migration**: alembic is used for databse migration (kind of git for databases).
You can read more about alembic [here](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html), or take a look at this tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdcH6IEi6nE&list=WL&index=6).

When ANY changes is made to the database model file, then a migration has to happen. This is done by the following commands:

```bash
# Create migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Revision message, something relevant here"

# Apply latest migration
alembic upgrade head
```

### Run tests:
To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
make test-backend
```

Or if you are using Windows, you can run the following described in the Makefile [here](./Makefile)

### Test result:

### Troubleshooting (for manual setup):

The command

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Is intended for Linux and does not always work on windows.
Therefore, windows users using VS code, could install the extension `Powershell` (Picture below), to run the activate script in the `venv`-folder. Then manually run the script by clicking the script and clicking `run`.

1. First install the `Powershell` extension

![Step 1 windows](../docs/Pictures/backend/troubleshooting_4.PNG)

2. Then go into `backend/venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1` and run the script.

![Step 2.1 windows](docs/Pictures/backend/troubleshooting_1.PNG)
![Step 2.2 windows](docs/Pictures/backend/troubleshooting_2.PNG)

3. Click this file and run it. If you see a green `(venv)` in the terminal, then the virtual environment is activates. You can now run the rest of the commands above.

![Step 3 windows](docs/Pictures/backend/troubleshooting_3.PNG)

4. You can now run the rest of the commands to setup and run backend

```bash

# Installing python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Apply migration scripts
alembic upgrade head

# Run the backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Running at 127.0.0.1:8000
```
